		As an additional cost to cast this spell, you may exile a card with mana value 5 or greater from your graveyard.
		Reveal the top five cards of your library, then an opponent separates them into two piles. If you paid <atom-cardname><nospellcheck>Final Arrival</nospellcheck></atom-cardname>’s additional cost, put both into your hand. Otherwise, put one into your hand and the other into your graveyard.
